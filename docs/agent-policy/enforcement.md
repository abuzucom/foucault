# Enforcement

Repository hooks provide defense in depth. Repository writers can modify them.
Tamper resistance requires an external harness, filesystem isolation, or
server-side controls.

Adopt every gate with its registrations, shared modules, tests, and checkers.
Missing artifacts indicate incomplete adoption. Complete the adoption and run
the recovery check.

The gates refuse destructive commands, unsafe infrastructure access, direct
GitHub CLI lookup, unsafe GitHub HTTP substitutes, credential-manager access,
browser token recovery, and incomplete policy loading.

The gates route consent-required acts to the active human. Unattended sessions
refuse those acts.

Designed denials, prompts, refusals, opaque-command blocks, and exit code 2 on
missing shared modules are policy outcomes. They are not defects.

Run:

- `python scripts/check_gate_adoption.py`
- `python scripts/check_hook_launchers.py`
- `python scripts/check_hook_coverage.py`
- `python scripts/sync.py --check-shared`
- `python -m unittest tests.test_gate_parity -v`

The checks cover only observed files, commands, clients, and event surfaces.
External controls must enforce controls beyond repository coverage.

The complete adoption inventory and recovery procedure cover every hook,
registration, shared module, test, checker, manifest, policy file, and
synchronized copy. A designed-denial defect report includes the exact input,
contradictory policy text, and a reproduction. Report a blocked file, command,
and message. A blocking gate does not authorize another act.

Use a CI job, pre-commit hook, or script for mechanically checkable rules.
State the limitation for rules that require human semantic review.

The destructive gate set includes the Bash, PowerShell, CMD, shared parser,
platform policy, shared gate, and parity-test files. Register Bash, PowerShell,
and available CMD `PreToolUse` matchers. Require matching Git and destructive
verdicts across all shell gates.

`scripts/check_banned_agents.py` checks authors, committers,
`Co-authored-by` trailers, and pull request authors. It cannot identify hidden
agent use under a human identity. Platform controls apply separately.

`AGENTS.md` controls when linked documents conflict with it.

Claude Code's consent hook reads paths. New test files do not prompt. Existing
test edits prompt. A final `ExistingTest = None` assignment can disable a
textual implementation. The Bash gate also protects existing tests reached by
redirects, `tee`, `sed -i`, `cp`, or `mv`.

Adopt the consent hook with `hooks/require_consent.py`, `hooks/_gate_core.py`,
its test, and the `.claude/settings.json` `PreToolUse` registration for
`Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`. Adopt the matching Bash protection. Do not
adopt one gate without the other.
